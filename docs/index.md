# DataManager Workbench

**DataManager** is a FreeCAD workbench for auditing and cleaning up:

- **VarSets** (`App::VarSet`) and their variables
- **Spreadsheet aliases** (`Spreadsheet::Sheet`) and their alias names

It helps you:

- Filter and browse VarSets/Spreadsheets and their child items.
- Inspect expression references to variables/aliases.
- Identify and remove **unused** variables/aliases.
